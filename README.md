My name is Jordan Radnich and I'm currently a student at Central Seattle College studying software engineering. I live in Olympia, Washington and I love technology. I also have an Associate's Degree in General Business Management from Liberty University. 
I have a background in customer service and sales through three years of retail experience. Iâ€™m diligent, honest, hard-working, and fully able to pick up the torch of leadership. Other than tinkering with computer stuff, I enjoy playing video games and spending time with my friends. 
I am eager to learn and help out with anything I can, so please get in contact if you have questions about anything or if you would like help and I will do my best to accommodate.
