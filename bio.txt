My name is Jordan Radnich and I'm currently a student at Central Seattle College studying software engineering. I live in Olympia, Washington and I love technology. 
I've had an interest ever since I was 6 or 7 when I got my first computer. 
Other than tinkering with computer stuff, I enjoy playing video games and spending time with my friends. 
I am eagar to learn and help out with anything I can, so please get in contact if you have questions about anything or if you would like help and I will do my best.
If you would like my linkedin, please ask me and I will send it over.
