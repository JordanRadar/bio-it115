My name is Jordan Radnich and I'm currently a student at Central Seattle College studying software engineering.
I live in Olympia, Washington and I love technology. 
I also have an Associate's Degree in General Business Management from Liberty University. 
I have a background in customer service and sales, and Iâ€™m diligent, honest, hard-working, and am fully able to pick up the torch of leadership.
I've had an interest ever since I was 6 or 7 when I got my first computer. 
Other than tinkering with computer stuff, I enjoy playing video games and spending time with my friends. 
I am eagar to learn and help out with anything I can, so please get in contact if you have questions about anything or if you would like help and I will do my best.
